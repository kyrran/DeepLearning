# Deep Learning Coursework

This repository contains the coursework for the Deep Learning module, including two key projects focused on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative models.

## Coursework 1: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

For this coursework, the focus was on building and training various CNN components from scratch, along with applying them to a real-world high-dimensional classification task.

### Key Accomplishments:
- Built and implemented convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and batch normalization layers from scratch using PyTorch.
- Designed a simplified ResNet-18 model, optimizing it for image classification tasks.
- Achieved high accuracy on benchmark datasets by refining the model's architecture and hyperparameters.
- Conducted thorough evaluations of model performance, including visualizations of training and validation progress, to better understand the behavior of deep learning models.

### Notebooks:
- **[Coursework 1 Notebook](https://github.com/kyrran/DeepLearning/blob/main/dl_cw_1.ipynb)**: This notebook walks through the step-by-step implementation of CNN components, ResNet-18, and the detailed analysis of model performance.

## Coursework 2: Generative Models

In the second coursework, the emphasis shifted to understanding and implementing generative models using popular datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10.

### Part 1: Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
- Implemented a VAE using the MNIST dataset.
- Focused on understanding the variational inference process and how the model learns latent representations of data.
- Evaluated the quality of generated images by varying the latent space sampling.

### Part 2: Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)
- Built a DCGAN for generating images using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Explored the training dynamics of adversarial networks and experimented with different network configurations.
- Some focus was placed on generating high-quality images while keeping an emphasis on understanding the model's behavior and learning process.

### Notebooks:
- **[Coursework 2 VAE & DCGAN Notebook](https://github.com/kyrran/DeepLearning/blob/main/dl_cw2_2024.ipynb)**: This notebook contains the full implementation and analysis of both the Variational Autoencoder and the DCGAN models, including training results and visualizations of the generated images.
