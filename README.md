# DeepLearning

## Coursework 1
- Built and trained convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and batch normalization layers from scratch using PyTorch.

- Designed and optimized a simplified ResNet-18 models for high-dimensional classification tasks, achieving high accuracy on benchmark datasets.

- Conducted thorough performance evaluations and visualizations of training progress, enhancing understanding of deep learning model behaviors.

## Coursework 2
For this coursework, you are asked to implement two commonly used generative models:
1. A Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
2. A Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)

For the first part you will the MNIST dataset https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database and
for the second the CIFAR-10 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).


The emphasis of both parts lies in understanding how the models behave and learn, however,
some points will be available for getting good results with your GAN (though you should not
spend too long on this).
