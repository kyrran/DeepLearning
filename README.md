# DeepLearning
## Coursework 2
For this coursework, you are asked to implement two commonly used generative models:
1. A Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
2. A Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)

For the first part you will the MNIST dataset https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database and
for the second the CIFAR-10 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).


The emphasis of both parts lies in understanding how the models behave and learn, however,
some points will be available for getting good results with your GAN (though you should not
spend too long on this).
